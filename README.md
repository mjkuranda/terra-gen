# terra-gen
Program that generates simple world.

You can generate simple world (containing plains, forests, mountain and oceans).
You can also generate rivers - it's optional but it's default enabled.

Finally, you can save you world image file clicking right mouse button on the canvas and selecting "Save" option.

I hope I use it to create my dream game, but I'll see (:
